# GSoC 2025 Proposal – DeepLense: Dark Matter Substructure Detection

This repository is for my GSoC 2025 proposal under **ML4Sci**, focused on enhancing the DeepLense framework — a deep learning pipeline for detecting and classifying dark matter substructures using strong gravitational lensing data.

## 📌 Project Overview

DeepLense uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on simulated lensing images to distinguish between theoretical dark matter models (e.g., WIMPs, condensates, superfluids). This project aims to:
- Improve model architecture and robustness
- Add model interpretability (e.g., saliency maps, Grad-CAM)
- Explore unsupervised extensions for low-data regimes
- Prepare for LSST-scale datasets in the near future

## 📅 Timeline Highlights
- Reproduce existing DeepLense pipeline
- Improve simulations and training loops
- Build interpretable and modular ML models
- Document and package for scientific use

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python, PyTorch, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Astropy, Jupyter Notebooks

## 🔭 Why This Project?
I've always been fascinated by space and physics, and this project blends deep learning with astrophysical simulations — two fields I’m passionate about contributing to.

🧠 *More files and exploration notebooks will be added soon as I continue learning and building toward the summer.*
